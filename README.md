Hello there, thank you for checking out my project!

RSHelper is a project inspired by D3Helper, a script used to automate ability casting in Diablo 3.

Why use RSHelper?
RSHelper focuses on automising chores such are drinking overloads, weapon poisons etc.
Additionally anything that you can place on your ability bar can be automated. This includes:
Summoning Familiars, Applying seren spells, Using Excalibur / Ritual shard and much more.

What can you expect from RSHelper?
- 5 Customisable keybinds (including Shift, Alt, CTRL binds) each with a seperate Interval. The interval has a 0-150ms delay to avoid bot detection.
- A Script time-out, this causes the script to automatically terminate after a set time. Perfect for timing up alongside an aura.
- Auto-looter, enabling this causes a spacebar keystroke to be sent every 20-30 seconds. This will loot assuming you have the area-loot interface open.
- Save Settings, an option that duplicates a script and allows you to save a new script with the settings that are currently in the interface.
  This allows you to have multiple different versions of this script for different tasks.

The script is written in AutoHotKey format and is open source. Feel free to give feedback or fork versions
If you wish to support me you can find a link to my PayPal inside the script itself under ReadMe.
