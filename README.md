Welcome to RSHelper!

RSHelper is inspired by D3Helper, a popular automation script for Diablo 3. It’s designed to streamline repetitive tasks in RuneScape, making your gameplay smoother and more efficient.
Why Use RSHelper?

RSHelper focuses on automating in-game chores like drinking overloads, applying weapon poisons, and much more. Anything that can be placed on your ability bar can be automated, including:

✔ Summoning familiars
✔ Casting Seren spells
✔ Using Excalibur / Ritual Shard
✔ And many other useful actions!

This script features:
- Five customizable keybinds – Supports Shift, Alt, and CTRL modifiers, each with its own interval. To reduce detection risks, a 0-150ms random delay is applied to keystrokes.
- Script timeout – The script can automatically terminate after a set duration, making it perfect for syncing with auras.
- Auto-looter – Sends a spacebar keystroke every 20-30 seconds to loot items, assuming you have the area-loot interface enabled.
- Save Settings – Create custom versions of the script with your current settings saved, allowing you to switch between setups easily.

The script is open-source and written in AutoHotkey. Feedback and forks are welcome! If you’d like to support the project, you’ll find a PayPal link inside the script under the ReadMe section.
